| ACTION  | The action of file copying, its value includes 'PUSH'/'PULL'/'PUSH_RECHECK'. <br/>'PUSH' and 'PULL' do not need to be set, determined by SOURCE_URL and TARGET_URL('PUSH': local->ftp server; 'PULL': ftp server->local). <br/>'PUSH_RECHECK' means that after pushing to the ftp-server, re-pull to verify the consistency of the transmission. |
| NUM_PGET_CONN  | Maximum number of connections to get the specified file using several connections, default value is 4 |
